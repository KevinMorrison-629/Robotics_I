
Notes on running the project files:


	-Each section of the project is separated into separate functions.

	-These functions, run at the end of the file, can be individually uncommented out to run the generate plots/ figures.

	-The generation of the a few figures is done after the pygame window is closed, so do this before closing out the program.

	-Matplotlib sometimes does not like saving over files, so in order to generate a new file, it is recommended that the
		old file is deleted.

	-It is recommended that the functions not be run all at the same time.

	-An mp4 file is included here. This is a video of the robot as it moves along the path with time.
